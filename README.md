# Crusade Tracker

This application is meant to schedule places, dates and times for [Warhammer 40,000](https://www.warhammer-community.com/) players to schedule games with each other and track information for the game's Crusade mode.  
Additiaonally, this application digitally tracks wargear, battle honors, battle scars, statistic modifiers etc. of individual units that comprise a player's Crusade army. It also records the resources that a player has available to them to spend on army upgrades as well as any purchased upgrades themselves.  
Victories and losses are recorded and visible to players that participate in Crusades together.
